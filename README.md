# The Pathfinders Lethal Company Modpack
 A fantastic multiplayer modpack that tries to stay true to the original feel with some minor content additions and quality of life adjustments.
 
 An update to this pack requires recreating your r2modman profile only in the case where a mod is removed. Mod additions or configuration changes shouldn't require recreating your profile.
 - In the case of recreation, you will lose your personalizations like cosmetics and player made profiles, unless you go into the profile and take a backup of your personalized files.
 
 If available, you should always update every mod after opening the pack in r2modman.
 
 If you have saves that you wish to maintain, take a backup before installing this modpack.
 
 I'm inept at versioning. The date doesn't have to precisely measure the scope of my updates. :D 
 
#### Known issue(s):
- On startup **EmployeeAssignments** says it's out of date, but it's not. :D
- EXP going down. This occurs when you lose a value of scrap from your ship (keys, stop signs, shotguns, or any other scrap) greater than what you gain. This is a vanilla bug in which scrapCollectedInLevel is divided by totalScrapValueInLevel resulting in a negative value. Or so it seems :)
- It seems that sometimes items go invisible. Still carriable and pingable, just invisible.
