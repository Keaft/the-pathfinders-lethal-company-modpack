# The Pathfinders Lethal Company Modpack
 A fantastic multiplayer modpack that tries to stay true to the original feel with some minor content additions and quality of life adjustments.
 
 An update to this pack requires recreating your r2modman profile only in the case where a mod is removed. Mod additions or configuration changes shouldn't require recreating your profile.
 
 [THIS INFORMATION IS FOR THE TIME BEING INCORRECT] If available, you should always update every mod after opening the pack in r2modman.
 There are ongoing issues with some mods and updating has had a streak of causing problems as of late. Do not update mods when starting the profile in r2modman. Always delete and recreate the profile in the event of a Pathfinders Lethal Company Modpack update.
 
 If you have saves that you wish to maintain, take a backup before installing this modpack.
 
 I'm inept at versioning. The date doesn't have to precisely measure the scope of my updates. :D Versioning will be as follows: [year].[month].[update_number]
 
#### Known issue(s):
- EXP going down. This occurs when you lose a value of scrap from your ship (keys, stop signs, shotguns, or any other scrap) greater than what you gain. This is a vanilla bug in which scrapCollectedInLevel is divided by totalScrapValueInLevel resulting in a negative value. Or so it seems :)
