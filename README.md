# The Pathfinders Lethal Company Modpack
 A modpack that tries to stay true to the original feel with some minor content additions and quality of life adjustments.
 
 Always update every mod after opening the pack in r2modman.
 
 If you have saves that you wish to maintain, take a backup before installing this modpack.
 
 I'm inept at versioning. The date doesn't have to precisely measure the scope of my updates. :D
